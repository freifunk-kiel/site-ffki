Firmware Site Config for Freifunk Kiel
--------------------------------------

The Freifunk firmware is based on gluon.

You can always find
the latest gluon documentation at:
https://gluon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/site.html

# Autoupdater Sources

We are working with those autoupdater branches:

## nightly
Build on the site-ffki branch `nightly`, probably with BROKEN=1.
These builds are created automatically and will possibly break your devices
without prior notice. Use only if you know what you are doing.

## release-candidate (rc)
Built on the site-ffki branch `master`. These builds are initiated manually
and should be more or less stable. However they are still in testing for a
reason. Use this if you want to offer your devices as test-platforms for the
upcoming stable releases.

## stable
Not built directly but instead release-candidates are "promoted" to stable
after they have been thoroughly tested.

# Development

## General process

- Usually no commits should affect `master` directly.
- Development for new firmwares takes place in the `nightly` branch.
- Buildbot creates new firmwares from `nightly` as needed.
- Release for new firmware is prepared through pull request from `nightly` to `master`
- After consensus over pull request, new master is manually built in buildbot as release candidate.
- Initial signature by developer allows update of rc nodes.
- After testing, release candidate is promoted to stable and signed by developers.
